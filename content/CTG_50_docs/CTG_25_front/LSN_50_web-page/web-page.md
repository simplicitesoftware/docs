External Custom Web Pages
=========================

This document covers the use of Smplicité's External Objects, as webpages standing aside Simplicité's instance. In other words, those objects are rendered as external pages, not within the Simplicité application UI.

## Native webpages

> Using HTML : CSS : Javascript only

## Webpages using frameworks

> Possible use for Vue.js or templating tools (mustache?)
