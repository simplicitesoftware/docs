# Dashboard 

## What is a Dashboard ?

Since version 6.2, Simplicité has enabled end users to create and share their own dashboards.
A dashboard is a visual interface that provides an overview of key data, metrics, and insights in a structured and interactive way.  

- Filters and Selections : Users can filter data by period, category or other criteria.

- Drill-Down (Data Exploration) : Click on an element (bar, point on a graph) to see more details.

- Dynamic updates : Data is often connected to databases in real time.

- Customisation : Simplicité allows users to change the display, rearrange widgets and create their own reports.

- Sharing : Simplicité allows users to share their dashboards.
