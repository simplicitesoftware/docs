Notifications
====================

Notifications are configured in **Social/Notifications/Configuration** V5 version **Interaction utilisateur/Notifications/Configuration** V6 version.  
They allow to alert users when an event occurs.

Notifications are linked to a business object, they are triggered by an action (create, update, delete) and can optionally have an execution condition in the form of an [expression](/lesson/docs/core/expressions).

A notification can be sent through multiple broadcast channels and sent to multiple recipients. Its content is defined by language and can be overriden for a particular channel and/or recipient. 

Recipients can be concerned by all of the notification's channels or be set up individually for a more precise configuration per recipient. 

Users have the option to subscribe or unsubscribe from the notifications they receive (via the *Subscriptions* button on their notification list).

**The channels** :
* Internal : The counter of a bell icon visible in the platform's header is updated with each new notification. Notifications are stored in a system table
* Mail : An email is sent to the recipients of the notification
* Specific : Invokes a method of the business object linked to the notification
* Web Push *(Simplicit√© v6.0+)*: Sends a push notification to the user's browser. This channel requires a set of system parameters :
    - **WEBPUSH** : `yes`
    - **WEBPUSH_VAPID_KEY** : <generated VAPID public key>
    - **WEBPUSH_PRIVATE_KEY** : <generated VAPID private key>
    - **WEBPUSH_VAPID_MAILTO** : `mailto:<contact-email>`

**Recipients** can be :
* User : a named user of the platform
* Group : a group of users
* SQL : the result of an SQL query

Exercise
====================

Create an **internal notification** that alerts users in the `TRN_ADMIN` group when an order is validated :
1. Configure the notification :
    * Name : **TrnOrderValidated**
    * Action : **Update**
    * Module : **Training**
    * Object : **TrnOrder**
    * Expression: `[OLDVALUE:trnOrdStatus] == 'P' && [VALUE:trnOrdStatus] == 'V'` *warning: the codes corresponding to the status may be different depending on your configuration* 
2. Configuration of the broadcast channels:
    * Associate the channel **Internal**
3. Content configuration:
    * Language : **English**
    * Module : **Training**
    * Subject : *empty* (corresponds to the subject of an email or the title of a Web Push notification)
    * Content: `The [VALUE:trnOrdNumber] order has been validated`.
4. Configuration of the recipients : 
    * Order: **10**
    * Type: **Group**
    * Group: **TRN_ADMIN**
5. Synchronise notification recipients
    * Click on the **Synchronise Recipients** action available on the list of notifications. This action allows to generate a subscription for each one of the Notification's recipients.
6. Add the **NOTI_READER** group to the **TRN_ADMIN** Profile
7. Clear the cache

Exercise (autonomous)
====================

* Create a notification that alerts users in the **TRN_READONLY** group when the **stock of a product** becomes **lower than 10**. Users should receive an **mail** and an **internal** notification. 
**The content of the email must be different from the content of the internal notification.
