# External object

An external object is a custom HTML page/component that can be made available in the same way as a business object in ui.
An external object can for example be used to add a custom page based on the current user to a domain.
Associated with different Simplicit√© hooks, it allows for example to serve the timesheet(s) linked to the user from a domain or on his home page.
External objects can be defined from the Interface/External objects menu.

The object is parameterized by resources, the create resources button generates a generic HTML page (HTML/css/JavaScript).

## Exercise
Create a simple external object that says hello to the current user. This object will be reused later.
